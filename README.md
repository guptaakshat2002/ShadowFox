       * Line Plot
       * Scatter Plot
       * Bar Chart
       * Histogram
       * Pie Chart

 2. Seaborn

       * Line Plot
       * Scatter Plot
       * Bar Plot
       * Histogram
       * Box Plot

### Contents

1. Library Overview:

    * Brief introduction to Matplotlib and Seaborn.
    * Unique features and typical use cases for each library.

2. Graph Types:
    * Documentation of various types of graphs available in each library.
    * Description, potential use case, and a code example for each graph type.

3. Comparison:
    * Discussion on the strengths and weaknesses of each library in terms of ease of use, customization options, interactivity, and performance with large datasets.

### Getting Started
#### Prerequisites
  
To run the code examples provided in the documentation, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
  * Matplotlib
  * Seaborn
  * Pandas (for data handling)

You can install these libraries using pip:
              
    pip install matplotlib seaborn pandas

Running the Examples

To run the examples, simply copy the code snippets provided in the documentation into your Python environment or script. Each example includes the necessary import statements and a brief description of the plot it generates.
